\section{Introduction}

Understanding the character of precipitation within a changing climate has a major focus of climate science, primarily due to the pronounced impacts of water availability on socioeconomic and natural systems \citep{hegerl2004detectability, kharin2007changes, scoccimarro2013heavy}.  Among these studies, there has been particular interest in precipitation extremes, which are manifested as drought and heavy precipitation events \citep{seneviratne2012changes}. Studies examining the character of precipitation in a warming world, which utilize models of varying complexity from simple thermodynamic models through complex coupled climate simulations, suggest that although atmospheric water vapor is increasing, the associated impacts of increased atmospheric water vapor on precipitation are far more complicated.  Extreme precipitation events are even more nuanced:  Some studies suggest that the intensity of extreme precipitation is projected to increase under global warming in many parts of the world, even in the regions where mean precipitation decreases \citep{tebaldi2006going, kharin2007changes}.

%Changes in rainfall distributions have attracted much attention because of the particular vulnerability of human activities to hydrological extreme events such as flood-producing rains and droughts. 
%The intensity of extreme precipitation is projected to increase under global warming in many parts of the world, even in the regions where mean precipitation decreases

%Globally, heat extremes have been increasing, with reducing extreme low temperatures


Although future climate predictions are known to be often associated with large uncertainties, climate models are nonetheless one of the most useful tools for studying climate variability and extremes events in the future \citep{easterling2000climate}. Global climate models (GCMs) are often used to investigate possible future changes in the mean, variability and extremes of climate, typically forced with predicted greenhouse gas (GHGs) concentrations and aerosol emissions. Precipitation extremes, as measured by various metrics, are predicted to change by future warming based on the results of these simulations \citep{meehl2006future}. Several past studies have investigated global impacts \citep{seneviratne2012changes}, but impacts at local and regional scales are more difficult to come by.  Although increased GHG concentrations have contributed to observed intensification of heavy precipitation events over the tropical ocean \citep{allan2008atmospheric} and the majority of Northern Hemisphere overland areas \cite{min2011human}, these impacts are much more poorly understood at regional scales due to atmospheric circulation patterns of variability \citep{trenberth2011changes}, which are more difficult to assess at the coarse model resolutions used in previous studies.

Insufficient regional-scale climate information has been a major outstanding problem in climate science, as stakeholders and water managers typically require fine-scale information on climate impacts in order to effectively develop adaptation and mitigation strategies.  In order to reach the scales needed for effective local planning, dynamical downscaling with regional climate models (RCMs) has been typically used to ascertain the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme events.  By only simulating a limited regional domain, RCMs better capture fine-scale dynamical features under high horizontal resolution \citep{bell2004regional, frei2006future, rauscher2010resolution, wehner2013very}. Higher resolution can also enable more accurate simulations of precipitation extremes, which can be driven by land use, land/water contrast, snow cover, cloudiness and circulation patterns associated with topography \citep{leung2003regional, diffenbaugh2005fine, salathe2008high, wehner2010effect}. \cite{diffenbaugh2005fine} studied both heat events and wet events over the contiguous United States based on RCMs simulation at 25 km horizontal resolution, and demonstrated that fine-scale processes are critical for accurate assessment of local- and regional-scale climate change vulnerability. \cite{leung2003hydroclimate} showed that the higher-resolution nests utilized by RCMs yield more realistic precipitation patterns and produce more frequent heavy precipitation over the western U.S. (WUS), which is in turn more consistent with observations.

%\citep{mass2011extreme} this paper has detailed discussion of precipitation extremes over western US modeled by other studies. (see the last two paragraphs)

%However, it does not mean that higher resolution can always perform better, and this aspect will be investigated in our study through multi-scale simulations including ~10km horizontal resolution.

%"Simulations with global coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation models (CGCMs) forced with projected greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions are the primary tools for studying possible future changes in climate mean, variability, and extremes. Changes in rainfall distributions have attracted much attention because of the particular vulnerability of human activities to hydrological extreme events such as flood-producing rains and droughts.

%"climate model improvements have resulted in an enhanced ability to simulate many aspects of climate variability and extremes. However, they are still characterized by systematic errors and limitations in accurately simulating regional climate conditions." \citep{easterling2000climate}

Despite their success, RCMs also have known issues associated with inconsistency between the lateral forcing data and the driven RCM, and the menu of physical parameterizations typically available to RCMs expose the potential for over-tuning the model for a particular geographic region \citep{mcdonald2003transparent, laprise2008challenging, mesinger2013limited}.  Consequently, there has been growing interest in variable-resolution enabled GCMs (VRGCMs) to improve regional climate simulations. Unlike RCMs, which require GCM data to drive the simulation at lateral boundaries, VRGCMs use a unified model with coarse global resolution and enhanced resolution over a specific study region \citep{staniforth1978variable, fox1997finite}. VRGCMs have demonstrated comparable utility for regional climate studies at a reduced computational cost, particular when compared to uniform-resolution GCMs \citep{fox2006variable, rauscher2013exploring}.

%Contrasted with RCMs, VRGCMs use a single, unified modeling framework rather than two separate models (GCM and RCM) with potentially disparate dynamics and physical parameterizations, avoiding the inconsistencies and lack of two-way interactions between the global and regional scales at the nest boundary of RCMs  

In this paper, we utilize the recently developed variable-resolution option in the Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM).  VR-CESM is based on the CESM (and its predecessor, the Community Climate System Model (CCSM)), a family of models that have been used for decades to study the global climate \citep{neale2010description, hurrell2013community}, and demonstrated competitive ability when contrasted with other climate models. The overall performance of VR-CESM for modeling regional climate in the California and Nevada is detailed in \cite{huang2016evaluation}, who argued VR-CESM has competitive biases in comparison to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (a traditional RCM), when evaluating both against high-quality observations and reanalysis. VR-CESM has also been employed for other studies and demonstrated that it is competitive at capturing fine-scale atmospheric processes with the uniform-resolution CESM and other RCMs, without apparent artifacts within the coarse-fine transition region \citep{zarzycki2014using, zarzycki2015effects, rhoades2015characterizing}.

%In our study, and previous studies (e.g. \cite{zarzycki2015effects}), general circulation patterns (e.g., wind, pressure and precipitation) do not exhibit apparent artifacts in the variable-resolution transition region, and the design of the SE dynamical core ensures that dry air and tracer mass are conserved globally \citep{taylor2010compatible}.

%statistical downscaling

%\cite{rhoades2015characterizing} has also assessed the promising use of VR-CESM for modeling Sierra Nevada mountain snowpack in the western United States. Variable resolution has also been employed by \cite{zarzycki2014using} to show that a high-resolution refinement patch in the Atlantic basin for simulating tropical cyclones represented significant improvements over the unrefined simulation. \cite{zarzycki2015effects} have compared the large-scale climatology of VR-CESM 0.25$^\circ$ and uniform CESM at 1$^\circ$, evaluated with reanalysis (MERRA, NCEP) dataset, and found that adding a refined region over the globe did not significantly affect the global circulation. In our study, as in \cite{zarzycki2015effects}, general circulation patterns (e.g., wind, pressure and precipitation) do not exhibit apparent artifacts in the variable-resolution transition region, and the design of the SE dynamical core ensures that dry air and tracer mass are conserved globally \citep{dennis2011cam, taylor2010compatible, taylor2011conservation}.


%VR-CESM is driven by the Community Atmosphere Model's (CAM's) Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core, which possesses attractive conservation and parallel scaling properties \citep{dennis2011cam, taylor2011conservation}, as well as recently developed variable-resolution capabilities \citep{zarzycki2014aquaplanet, zarzycki2015experimental}. 

This study focuses changes in the character of precipitation over the 21st Century within the WUS, as predicted from long-term ensemble runs conducted with VR-CESM with a local grid resolution of $\sim$0.25$^\circ$.  The WUS is known to be particularly vulnerable to hydrological extreme events, particularly floods and droughts \citep{leung2003hydroclimate, caldwell2010california}, and features a variety of local features and microclimates associated with its rough and varied topography.  Simulations of the future climate are performed in accordance with the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario \citep{riahi2011rcp}, which describes a ``business-as-usual'' projection for GHGs among other RCPs.  Only RCP8.5 is considered since recent GHG emissions have been more closely aligned with this scenario {\color{red}[citation needed]} and end-of-century projections with the substantially weaker RCP2.6 scenario are observed to be qualitatively similar to mid-century RCP8.5 results. Simulations are further conducted in accordance with the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocol \citep{Gates1992}, a widely-used approach for climate model diagnosis, validation and intercomparison that imposes global sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice.  By constraining atmospheric boundary conditions at the sea surface, we avoid model biases that are known to exist in the fully coupled configuration {\color{red}[citation needed]} and accept potential uncertainties associated with our choice of SSTs.

%lobal SSTs and sea ice are prescribed in accordance with the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocol \citep{Gates1992}, which are widely used supporting climate model diagnosis, validation and intercomparison.

Changes in the character of precipitation, in terms of frequency and intensity, have been assessed in our study from recent history through the end of 21st century.  A comprehensive set of metrics for precipitation extremes have been evaluated from ensemble simulations over the 27-year periods corresponding to historical (1979-2005), mid-century (2024-2050) and end-of-century (2074-2100). Using this information, it is our goal to improve our understanding of precipitation at relatively fine spatial scales. We hypothesize that spatial inhomogeneity in local geography and temperature will also result in similarly inhomogeneous impacts on the precipitation field.  We further expect that teleconnections (specifically the El Nin\~o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) will have a pronounced impact on precipitation features over particular area under the changes of mean SST and its variations.  Since only one SST dataset was used for this study, we note that our projections are conditioned on a particular future character of ENSO.  This is a potentially large source of uncertainty, as at present there is no clear consensus on how ENSO may behave under a warming climate {\color{red}[citation needed]}, and strengthening or weakening of this pattern will have clear consequences for our results.

%In particular, we hypothesize that mean precipitation and precipitation extremes undergo different characteristics of changes regulated by a predicted scenario for different regions. 

This work builds on a number of previous studies that have explored the projected future change in WUS precipitation. For example, \cite{kim2005projection} applied downscaled climate change signals to selected indicators, and concluded that global warming induced by increased CO$_2$ is likely to drive increases in extreme hydrologic events in the WUS. \cite{duffy2006simulations} found that precipitation extremes have {\color{red} become increasingly frequent and intense (?)} over the WUS, {\color{red}although the spatial distribution of these extremes varied} substantially among RCMs. \cite{gao2015dynamical} pointed out a potentially large increase in atmospheric river events by the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario {\color{red}[this is probably something we can assess in our data using AR detection and characterization]}. 

%For our study, we employ relatively high resolution ($\sim$28 km) covering the WUS over long-term period (26 years) of each time phase. We use a variable-resolution global climate model (rather than the low-resolution GCMs or RCMs that have been previously used). Also, a different sets of indices are used to describe the changes of precipitation behaviors with a comprehensive analysis of potential causes including the effect of ENSO and climate forcing.

\section{Model Setup} \label{sec:ModelSetup}

CESM is a state-of-the-art Earth modeling framework, consisting of coupled atmosphere, ocean, land and sea ice models \citep{CAM5Tech, hurrell2013community}. In this study, Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) \citep{CAM5Tech} and the Community Land Model version 4.0 \citep{CLM40Tech} are used. Within CAM5, we use the Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core, which incorporates the variable-resolution option \citep{zarzycki2014using} and includes desirable conservation and parallel scalability properties \citep{dennis2011cam, taylor2011conservation}.  CLM is employed in the \textit{unigrid} configuration, which allows the land model to be co-located with the atmospheric grid and so eliminates the need for interpolation.  SSTs and sea ice, which are used to compute ocean-atmosphere fluxes, are prescribed in accordance with the AMIP protocol \citep{Gates1992}. The variable-resolution mesh used for this study is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 1}, in accord with our past studies  \citep{rhoades2015characterizing, huang2016evaluation} {\color{red}[cite irrigation study]}.

%The finest horizontal resolution is $\sim$28 km covering the WUS, with a quasi-uniform 1$^\circ$ mesh over the remainder of the globe (See Figure \ref{fig:Figure 1}). A detailed description of the employed techniques of VR-CESM, including the grids generation, topography preparation and component set, can be found in \cite{rhoades2015characterizing} and \cite{huang2016evaluation}. 

%The coupling infrastructure in CESM communicates the interfacial states and fluxes between each component model to ensure conservation. Since we follow AMIP protocols, only the atmosphere and land model are integrated dynamically. The FAMIPC5 (F$\_$AMIP$\_$CAM5) component set, which mainly supports atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea ice models, is chosen for these simulations. In CAM5, cloud microphysics is parameterized using the two-moment scheme with with ice supersaturation \citep{ morrison2008new, gettelman2008new}, and the deep convection process is treated by Zhang and McFarlane (ZM) cumulus scheme \citep{zhang1995sensitivity}. A more detailed discussion of the CAM5 configuration can be found in \citet{neale2010description}.

Simulations have been performed for the historical period (1979-2005, hereafter referred to as \textsf{hist}) and for two future periods: 2024-2050 (hereafter referred to as \textsf{mid}) and 2074-2100 (hereafter referred to as \textsf{end}). For purposes of analysis, the first year of each time period was discarded as a spin-up period to allow adequate time for the initialized land and atmosphere to equilibrate. The 26-year duration was chosen to provide an adequate sampling of annual variability for each time phase. For future projections, GHG concentrations are set based on RCP8.5. Historical SSTs and sea ice are prescribed at 1$^\circ$ resolution, as described by \citet{hurrell2008new}. SSTs and sea ice for each future period are developed from fully-coupled RCP 8.5 climate simulations with  bias correction applied (Cecile Hannay, personal communication).  Using prescribed SSTs in place of a coupled ocean model considerably reduces the computation cost and so allows the atmospheric model to be run at a higher overall resolution. Annually-updated land surface datasets, which prescribe land-use characteristics, are interpolated from $0.5^\circ$ to the land model grid.

%The historical simulations cover the period of year 1979 through 2005 (Hereafter as Hist), representing the reference period for model evaluation and for the calculation of climate changes. The transient future projections cover two periods including near future 2024-2050 (Hereafter as Mid) and late-century 2074-2100 (Hereafter as End). 
%including plant functional types

%SST file: /glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/atm/cam/sst

%In particular, observed SSTs and sea ice at 1$^\circ$ horizontal resolution are provided and updated following the procedure described by \citet{hurrell2008new}.

Ensemble runs are needed to ensure that the sample adequately accounts for climate variability, especially for statistics associated with climatological extremes. However, the exact number of ensemble members required is heavily dependent on the variability of the particular metric being examined, and so no standard ensemble criteria exists \citep{deser2012uncertainty}. \cite{deser2012uncertainty} suggest that at least three ensemble runs are required to detect a significant epoch difference for JJA surface temperatures, whereas more than 40 ensemble members are needed to observe statistically significant differences in precipitation {\color{red}[Is this for mean climatology or extremes?]}. In our study, the use of prescribed SSTs does reduce the intrinsic variability of the climate system (see supplement), and so we found reasonably converged results with two ensembles members for the historical period and four ensemble members for each future period.

%  Considering that we did not explicitly use coupled ocean model and we focused on regional area at much finer resolution, in this study, we did four runs for each future time period. We also have two runs for the historical period. Due to the relatively small uncertainty within the ensemble runs (see the supplement), we assume that the numbers of runs applied in this study are enough to satisfy our goal. 

%According to Ryan L. Sriver et al. (2014) {\color{red}(add citation)}, CESM ensemble show obviously smaller uncertainty than Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase (CMIP) 5 for both temperature and precipitation in North America.

%The use of an ensemble of simulations is particularly useful for also determining the statistics of the climatology generated in each case, including the mean and variance associated with each of the variables of interest.

%Actually, former studies of regional high-resolution climate extremes usually use no more than five members \citep{diffenbaugh2010intensification}. We will analyze the uncertainty among multi-scale simulations for heat and precipitation extremes distribution. We may increase the ensemble members if needed and computation resources allowed.

%multi-member ensemble simulations provide additional insight into sources of uncertainty within a model simulation (Rougier et al. 2009; Flato et al. 2013).

%GCM: meehl2004more use four for past, five for future; VRGCM with one simulation seem ok for past climate; based on sriver_ppt_Analyzing climate impacts using a low resolution CESM ensemble, pg18, five ensemble should be ok for heat extremes, but not enough for precipitation extremes, one VRGCM should be ok for mean climate.

%Richard: In fact, if you are doing 1 model run for historical simulations and only 5 for future climate, it is very unlikely you will have any unambiguous results. An example reference might be Deser et al, 2012, Nature Climate Change. Wallace, Fischer, Thompson, and Deser discussed this at length in their 4 separate talks at AGU last month. Deser has another paper which looks at numbers of model runs or time periods or similar needed and it is different for max T than for precipitation.


\section{Methodology} \label{sec:Methodology}

\subsection{Precipitation indices}

{\color{red}In order to capture the features of precipitation distributions, all the daily output are utilized to account for varied precipitation events occurring in different seasons for diverse climate regions. [Unclear]} We have employed standard indices to characterize precipitation \citep{tebaldi2006going, zhang2011indices, sillmann2013climate}. Several indices have been examined, including those defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) {\color{red}[citation needed]} {\color{red}and others [be explicit] from previous studies [what studies?]} that evaluate percentiles, maximum values, or {\color{red}the events changes of precipitation [?]}. The indices we have chosen for this study attempt to provide a relatively comprehensive characterization of precipitation, along with being easy to interpret and relevant to stakeholders.  The indices employed are summarized in Table \ref{tab:table1}.

%indices:  zhang2010influence, duliere2011extreme, 
%In this study, we have used selected indices in previous studies  \citep{tebaldi2006going, zhang2010influence, duliere2011extreme, zhang2011indices, sillmann2013climate} and also defined other indices that are suitable, well interpreted and describe extremes in a comprehensive and objective way. 
%(Before using indices method for extreme analysis, we need to select indices which are suitable, as easy as possible to be interpreted, being relevant for policy makers and describe extreme processes in a comprehensive and objective way \citep{sanchez2004future}.)

%The indices we used are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Table1} {\color{red}add table 1 based on $pr_extreme_Hist_2runs.pdf$}. We can divide the indices into two types. One kind is to describe the overall features of precipitation including the {\color{red} to be added}. The other kind is to define precipitation events, using specific rain rates of 1mm, 10 mm, 20 mm, 30mm, 40 mm and 50 mm as the thresholds. Specifically, a event is captured at each grid cell with consecutive days of rain rate exceeding corresponding threshold. A dry event is defined similarly except that it is the days without rain (Pr<=1.0mm/day). When capturing wet events, rainy days with precipitation rate less than the specific threshold are not treated as gap for different spells, and are surely not included in the wet event's duration length. 

%The indices are loosed based on the ones defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), which have been widely accepted and applied.

\subsection{Impacts of ENSO}


The impact of ENSO on precipitation is emphasized in our study due to its impact in regulating the precipitation over a majority of our study area, particularly in the southwest U.S. \citep{cayan1999enso, zhang2010influence, deser2012communication, yoon2015increasing}. The phase of ENSO (\textit{i.e.} El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na) is identified each year using the Oceanic Ni\~no Index (ONI), defined as the 3-month running means of SST anomalies in the Ni\~no 3.4 region (covering 5N-5S, 120-170W based on \cite{noaaElNino}). An El Ni\~no or La Ni\~na episode is said to occur when the ONI exceeds +0.5 or -0.5 for at least five consecutive months \citep{noaaElNino} (see the supplement). In order to remove the trend in the SST field associated with climate change, the anomaly is computed against the detrended mean SSTs from the periods 1971-2000, 2020-2050 and 2070-2100 for \textsf{hist}, \textsf{mid} and \textsf{end} respectively, using the aforementioned observed and predicted SST datasets.

%In order to separate the SST changes from the influence of climate forcing, the SST values for future time period have been detrended before calculating the ONI index. 

Some studies argue that Ni\~no 3.4 does not capture the ENSO signal well (like \cite{kao2009contrasting}), and so we have tried to widen the location (from 105W to 170W rather than from 120W to 170W ). It turns out that the SST anomaly of each year is quantitatively similar {\color{red}[if you include this you might need to quantify ``similar'']} to Ni\~no 3.4, particularly for the future period. Therefore, we presume it won't really affect our results whether we use the extended location or not. ({\color{red}might remove this?})

%linear regression is applied to signaling the factor effects due to ENSO and climate forcing. Firstly, we get the phase of ENSO over each year including El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na and normal state at each grid point over our study area followed by the way of ENSO 3.4 (add citation here) (add more details about how ENSO is calculated over each time period). Next, we naturally divide climate forcing into three scenarios represented by each time period. The features of wet or dry spell as we described above are used as response variable. Mathematically, the regression relationship can be written as, (add equation and explain it here).

%%%ENSO 3.4 using SST dataset define the baseline http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_change.shtml

%(fulfill the model assumption (p-norm) and the sizes should be enough)

Student's t-test has been used to test whether or not two datasets at each grid point are statistically equivalent, if the sample population can be adequately described by a normal distribution. The normality of a dataset is assessed under the Anderson-Darling test. When the sample populations do not approximately follow a normal distribution, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test is employed in lieu of the t-test. All these tests are evaluated at the 0.05 ($\alpha$) significance level.

%statistical significance for necessary variables: note the ad.test is based on sample size >7, therefore, this does not fit for extreme events that happen too less, combined all ensembles to get enough sample size


{\color{red}(add description of the supplement like what are included)}


\subsection{Reference datasets}

Gridded observational datasets and reanalysis of the highest available quality with comparable horizontal resolutions to our VR-CESM simulations are used for assessing the simulation quality. The use of multiple reference datasets is necessary due to the underlying uncertainty in the reference data. Descriptions of the datasets employed are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textbf{UW Precipitation Dataset:}  The UW daily gridded meteorological data is obtained from the Surface Water Modeling group at the University of Washington \citep{maurer2002long, hamlet2005production}. UW incorporates topographic corrections for the precipitation. The dataset is provided at 0.125$^\circ$ horizontal resolution covering the period 1949 to 2010.

\item[] \textbf{NCEP CPC:}  This dataset provides gauge-based analysis of daily precipitation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC). It is a suite of unified precipitation products obtained by combining all information available at CPC via the optimal interpolation objective analysis technique. The gauge analysis covers the Conterminous United States with a fine-resolution at 0.25$^\circ$ from 1948-01-01 to 2006-12-31.

\item[] \textbf{North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR):}  The is the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) high-resolution reanalysis product that provides dynamically downscaled data over North America at $\sim$32 km resolution and 3-hourly intervals from 1979 through present \citep{mesinger2006north}.
\end{itemize}

%Differences between gridded observations can be due to the choice of meteorological stations, interpolation techniques, elevation models and processing algorithms.

%ASD:  (“The high-resolution CESM was run under “present-day” (year 2000) greenhouse gas conditions (fixed CO2 concentration of 367 ppm). This was chosen so that direct comparisons could be made with recent-era observations of fine-scale and large-scale phenomena.”)  https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/home.html

%PRISM (too fine), CFSR (at 0.5degree, so does not fit here)

%PRISM: tried plot Tmax PDF over CV, the shape is strange and quite different from UW.

%CFSR 0.3 deg: reanalysis dataset. Tmax and Tmin is 6 hourly forecast, Rh is 6 hourly forecast at 0.5 degree (I interpolated it to 0.3 deg). These are not forecast datasets rather than reanalysis datasets.

\section{Model Assessment} \label{sec:ModelAssessment}

%(percentile and event number etc. in $index1\_ref\&hist.pdf$ (from v4) can be put in the supplement, the new features from v5 can also be added in the supplement)

Before proceeding, we first investigate how well the model is able to represent the character of precipitation over the WUS.  Figures \ref{fig:Figure 2} and Figure \ref{fig:Figure 3} depict the spatial character of the indices defined in Table \ref{tab:table1}.  Compared with observations, VR-CESM {\color{red}well represents the spatial pattern of precipitation. (quantify -- perhaps tabulate summary statistics.  You may need to focus on particular regions where the model performs well or performs poorly.  Also you should summarize your VR-CESM evaluation paper here.)}  Considering only the mean climatology, the majority of the precipitation remains distributed along the northwest coast and along the mountainous regions of the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada.  However, VR-CESM does overestimate the SDII (by about 25$\%$-35$\%$) along the western flank of the Sierra Nevada and into the CV.  {\color{red}[Is it possible to run a statistical test with UW, CPC and NARR as the three ``statistical samples'' and determine at each spatial point whether VR-CESM is statistically equivalent to these three?  You could then stipple the regions of VR-CESM that were statistically equivalent.]}

%In order to see whether the model can capture the historical features of precipitation, the results from VR-CESM and references are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 2} and Figure \ref{fig:Figure 3} using the indices defined in Table \ref{tab:table1}. 

Examining more specific metrics of precipitation, the frequency of rainy days and relative contribution to total precipitation are also {\color{red}satisfactorily represented} by the model, especially over the northwest and along the western flank of mountain ranges where mean precipitation is largest. However, the model tends to overestimate the number of rainy days over the eastern flank of the Cascades and into the Great Plains {\color{red}(eastern relatively dry region of our study area including part of the Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico)}, particularly for days with precipitation rate under 20 mm/day. Along with the rainy days of each defined range, the corresponding fraction of water amount is also {\color{red}well modeled (specify)}. Most precipitation over dry areas is associated with low Pr events (with Pr$=<$10mm/day), whereas most of the precipitation over wet areas is from extreme Pr events (when Pr$>$10mm/day). In fact, the overestimation of the SDII in the model primarily arises due to the overestimation of the extreme precipitation events (particularly for Pr$>$20mm/day). Biases in simulating extreme precipitation over the topographically complex regions have also been found by \cite{singh2013precipitation}, and have been primarily attributed to excessively strong winds.  {\color{red}Biases with the excessively dry eastern flanks of these mountains may also be associated with the prognostic treatment of precipitation species in CESM.}

CESM at 1 degree resolution was also assessed in order to better understand the impacts of resolution. We find that precipitation patterns over complex topography are {\color{red}poorly represented [explain]} by uniform CESM at 1 degree, with total precipitation greatly underestimated, even when compared to VR-CESM, gridded data and reanalysis (see the supplement). This result clearly captures the benefits of high resolution (particularly the representation of topography) in simulating precipitation features. Results are also provided for the output from a globally uniform CESM run at 0.25$^\circ$ spatial resolution with the finite volume (FV) dynamical core \citep{wehner2014effect}, exhibiting comparable performance to VR-CESM (see the supplement).

\section{Results} \label{sec:Results}

\subsection{Mean climatology}

Before proceeding with the analysis of precipitation features, it is first important to understand how the mean precipitation climatology changes in VR-CESM across time periods (Figure \ref{fig:Figure 4}). Since the character of WUS precipitation has a strong seasonal dependence, annual Pr is first divided into the cool season (or wet season) from October to March and the warm season (or dry season) from April to September. Note that the majority of the precipitation over the cool season emerged from large-scale patterns (such as atmospheric rivers), whereas warm season precipitation was from convection processes {\color{red}(including the North American Monsoon System) [check correctness of this statement]}.

As a result of enhanced GHG concentrations, mean annual temperature increases by about 1.5 to 2 K from \textsf{hist} to \textsf{mid} and about 3 to 3.5 K from \textsf{mid} to \textsf{end}. Despite the large spatial variation in climatological temperatures, the temperature change between historical and future is fairly uniform, with only a slightly weaker increase in the near-coastal regions. From \textsf{hist} to \textsf{mid}, mean precipitation showed the biggest change over the northwest, with a largest increase of 0.6 mm/day during cool season and less than 0.2 mm/day during warm season.  From \textsf{hist} to \textsf{end}, the increase is less than 1.0 mm/day during cool season.  Nonetheless, these results are statistically significant (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 5}).  East of the Rockies, precipitation increases through mid-century (statistically significant), but this trend appears to recede towards the end of the century (although these results are not significant).  There is also a decrease of about 0.1mm/day in total precipitation over the western flank of the Sierra Nevadas during the cool season from \textsf{hist} to \textsf{mid} which expands to cover the southwest into the end-of-century. This decrease (about 0.15 mm/day) is also found over the Cascades and the western coastal area during warm season from \textsf{hist} to \textsf{mid} with larger magnitude and extending to farther inland from \textsf{mid} to \textsf{end}. However, this decrease is not statistically significant.

{\color{red}[Motivate how water vapor content is related to precipitation]} To understand if water vapor content increases in accordance with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, 2m relative humidity (R2m) is also plotted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 4}. Overall, R2m remains {\color{red}relatively constant [quantify]}, with increases in RH primarily associated with regions where temperature does not substantially increase. However, in regions where temperature increase is {\color{red}larger than 1K [?]}, R2m is instead observed to decrease relative to historical values. In fact, trends in R2m are spatially consistent with temperature increases but opposite in magnitude {\color{red}[spatial correlation coefficient?]}. This suggests that continental evaporation and water vapor transport is insufficient to compensate for the vapor capacity of warmer air, and is consistent with \cite{joshi2008mechanisms}, and has been observed in results by \cite{rowell2006causes} {\color{red}(over xx geographical region)} and \cite{simmons2010low} {\color{red}(globally)}.  {\color{red}[May need to test significance of changes to 2mRH]}

{\color{red}[Similar to your first paper, this section largely provides a textual description of the figures without actually identifying why the changes are taking place.  More text is needed to make this connection.]}

%{{\color{red}might calculate a correlation between T2avg and R2m}}


%there is a consistent increase of 2m relative humidity over coastal region and west side of the Sierra Nevada in future, and slight decrease over most of the region during wet seasons. For dry seasons, the 2m relative humidity has slight increase over central-southern part of WUS during mid-century, and overall decrease over the remaining study area, especially during end-century. However, we also notice that over the rainy days, the 2m relatively humidity increases during mid-century, but decrease over end-century, which might suggest that when temperature increase high enough, the water vapor is not enough to support the corresponding changes of relative humidity.


%(R2m shows some interesting results when average over the rainy days of each range, with increase during Mid century (this is different from the average changes over all days) but decrease during End century, which might suggest that when temperature increase high enough, the water vapor is not enough to support the corresponding changes of relative humidity.  This can be further explained by the Q2m and T2avg.) 
%see wd\_R2m\_Mid-Hist\_End-Mid\_R5mm to Rxmm.pdf, wd_T2avg_Mid-Hist_End-Mid_R5mm to Rxmm.pdf, wd_Q2m_Mid-Hist_End-Mid_R5mm to Rxmm.pdf and wd_Q850_Mid-Hist_End-Mid_R5mm to Rxmm.pdf at the desktop. The latent heat flux is quite related with the result of the changes of low level relative humidity


%(About the dryness of the surface/underground and relative humidity)
%"The key factor causing drying is that land surfaces (and the air just above them) warm, on average, about 50$\%$ more than ocean surfaces \citep{joshi2008mechanisms}" "The second factor ensuring drying is that water vapor content over land does not increase fast enough relative to the rapid warming there." "Because the land warms faster than the oceans, however, the humidity of the arriving air does not increase enough to maintain a constant relative humidity. The latter must therefore fall on average (see the figure), as indeed seen in model simulations \citep{rowell2006causes} and observed on all continents \citep{simmons2010low}." "In a warmer climate, more rain is needed. Many regions will get more rain, but it appears that few will get enough to keep pace with the growing evaporative demand."


%The moisture flux at 850 hPa (horizontal transport of water vapor by the wind) (seems to be consistent with the changes of relative humidity) (how to interpret this?)

%Almost all of the precipitation is resulted from large-scale meteorological processes rather than convection processes, except the west-central regions of WUS during warm seasons.

\subsection{Precipitation indices}

We now turn our attention to the precipitation indices presented in Table \ref{tab:table1}.  For each index, the changes of precipitation character for each period, averaged over all ensemble members are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 5} (for the indices that quantify precipitation days) and Figure \ref{fig:Figure 6} (for the indices describing precipitation amounts). Although  mean precipitation shows a weak but overall increasing trend from \textsf{hist} to \textsf{mid} and \textsf{mid} to \textsf{end}, the precipitation indices exhibit substantially more variable character.

When comparing Hist to Mid, the total rainy days and frequency of non-extreme precipitation have significantly increased mainly over the central-east and southeast part of WUS, which is not observed between Mid and End. On the contrary, the total rainy days and frequency of non-extreme precipitation have decreased significantly over the northwest region and the eastern part of the Montana, Wyoming and Oregon from Mid to End. These can mainly explain the changes of mean precipitation as aforementioned in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 4}. 

%The combined changes of those is displayed when comparing Hist and End.

As for the extreme precipitation frequency (i.e. with daily Pr between 10 mm and 40 mm), there is a overall increase signal from Hist to Mid, but the pattern is scattered over northwest and central WUS. When comparing Mid to End, a clear and significant increase of extreme precipitation events can be observed over the northwest coastal area and eastern side of the Cascades. This result is consistent with what found by \cite{dominguez2012changes} stating a robust increases in the winter precipitation extremes toward the latter half of the 21st century using RCMs.

There are slight and not significant decreases (due to the high variation of precipitiaton) over the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. For the very extreme precipitation (Pr$>=$40 mm) events, there is a notable increasing trend over the northwest coast and the Cascades and its eastern side. The corresponding changes of rain amount are consistent with the changes of frequency (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 6}). Overall, precipitation predicts to be more extreme over northwest U.S.

({\color{red} might add the specific percentages for further illustrations})

%****According to previous studies (e.g. \citep{allen2002constraints, allan2008atmospheric, o2009physical, min2011human}), changes in more extreme precipitation follow the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, i.e. the atmospheric water vapor content increases at an approximate rate of 7.5$\%$ per kelvin of atmospheric temperature, more closely than total precipitation precipitation amount \citep{trenberth2003changing}. Based on CMIP3 simulation, \cite{kharin2007changes} argued that there will be an increase of annual one day maximum precipitation (Max1d) for about 6$\%$ with each kelvin of global warming, with ranging of 4$\%$-10$\%$ K with the models.

In order to figure out the causes behind those main signals, the changes of moisture flux is further investigated (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 8}) for cool seasons when majority precipitation results from the water vapor influx from the Pacific ocean. Taking the moisture flux at level of 850 hpa as representative, within expectation, specific humidity increases along with the increase of the temperature in future. However, comparing to Hist, the wind pattern in Mid and End also changes with reduced magnitude to the east over the eastern part of the WUS but with stronger wind to the western part. The integrated water vapor transport (IVT) is also depicted and included in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 8} for extreme precipitation days over cool seasons. Generally, IVT has been used to identify the major contribution of precipitation by atmospheric rivers over Northwest U.S. and the topographic forcing effect (especially for the very extreme precipitation) \citep{ralph2004satellite, leung2009atmospheric, dettinger2011climate}. Based on the IVT changes, it can be seen that the increase of moisture influx from past to future, which is mainly due to the change of the air water vapor content with the increased temperature, corresponds to the changes of precipitation extremes shown in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 5}.

%neiman2008meteorological

%the change of IWV is similar to the change of IVT, so not shown

In order to see the impacts of the large scale variability by ENSO from past to future, the difference of precipitation behaviors between the warm phase (i.e. El Ni\~no) and cool phase (i.e. La Ni\~na) of ENSO is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 7} for the wet seasons of each time period. Based on the ONI index values, the mean SST anomalies are 1.38, 1.71 and 2.30 K during El Ni\~n years, and -1.16, -1.62 and -1.43 K during La Ni\~na years for Hist, Mid and End respectively. The SST anomalies of each year or each month, and their spatial pattern averaged during the warm and cool phases can be found in the supplement ({\color{red}might adding some descriptions of these}).

%			Hist                Mid            		End
%La Ni\~na 		6, -1.163667  11, -1.616909  	11, -1.430182
%El Ni\~no		8, 1.38   10, 1.7149    	6,   2.297667

It can be seen that during El Ni\~no phases, higher precipitation intensity is expected over southwest U.S. \citep{hamlet2007effects}, and smaller precipitation intensity over the northwest U.S.. This feature is often characterized as a northwest/southwest precipitation dipole, causing by the effects of ENSO on cool season precipitation through the storm track behavior \citep{gershunov1998interdecadal, leung2003hydroclimate}, modulating the enhanced precipitation variability in the southern WUS \citep{cayan1999enso, kahya1994influences}. Consequently, the overall rainy days and extreme precipitation events also show that similar dipole pattern. In future, the impact of ENSO tends to intensify, which seems to be related with the changes of the strength of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. This can be explained by the SST anomaly magnitude (detrended) of warm and cold phases (see the supplement). \cite{deflorio2013western} also found a statistically significant linkages with ENSO and PDO for both the overall and extreme intensity of wintertime precipitation over the WUS using CCSM4 (earlier form of CESM). A strengthening patterns associated with ENSO is also found by \cite{maloney2014north} over California using CMIP5 output under RCP8.5. 


%***\cite{yoon2015increasing} found that the projected increase in water cycle extremes including intense drought and excessive flooding in California is associated with a strengthened relation to ENSO not only through its warm and cold phases but also its precursor patterns. The ENSO might shift in future under the changes in Northern Hemispheric low-frequency circulation and thermodynamic patterns \citep{berg2015increased}. 


({\color{red}For Figure 7, might add absolute values or percentage of changes, compared to the changes of climate forcing; explain why Pr and R5mm are not plotted.})

This is further proved by the IVT difference over rainy days between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 8} ) accompanying by the wind pattern difference at 850 hpa, showing the increase of the moisture flux for the southwest and decrease for the northwest. However, the impact of ENSO for observational precipitation has a weaker signal of the dipole effect compared to the VR-CESM (see the supplement), which might suggest that the model has a overestimation of the ENSO effect on precipitation, especially over the northwest U.S. The improvement of ENSO in the model is directly proportional to the representation of ENSO forced precipitation anomalies \citep{achutarao2006enso}.

Based on the above results, it can be seen that the magnitude of the effects of ENSO is comparable or even higher than the impacts of climate forcing. For further investigation, linear regression is applied to signaling the factor effects due to ENSO and climate forcing. First, we get the SST anomaly of each year at each grid point over our study area followed by the way of Ni\~no 3.4 to be the ENSO factor values. Then, we use the GHGs values at each year to represent the climate forcing factor. The features of the precipitation indices as we defined above are used as response variables. Combined the values of all the time period and all the runs, we got the significance of these two factors' effects at each grid point based on the ANOVA (analysis of variance) output. (see the supplement) ({\color{red}This is not complete yet, but not sure whether to add this or not}).

%Mathematically, the regression relationship can be written as, (add equation and explain it here).

%R5mm is not shown here due to the similarity to R10mm in Figure 5
 
 %Here, we only focus on wet season, since the ENSO is defined by the anomaly over wet season, also, ENSO did not really impact the summer season rain features due to the scarcity of rain.
%We did not use relative difference here since there is zero values over dry area for precipitation extreme and create abnormal high value of relative difference.

%plot the days results in different seasons: for values of result difference between ElNi\~no and LaNi\~no, the dry season did not show difference since the rain is so rare, therefore, no need to divide into season, but can just use the winter pattern of the discussion plot.
%ENSO did not really impact the summer season rain features; The overall differences between different time period over all years show some interesting features between dry and wet season, therefore, keeping this in seasons. As for the difference at each phase over each time period, it seems there is no necessary to do this, just using the anova model to get the significance.

%$note: It seems there is no overall significant trend of either event's features within each time period. (cesm_25_wd_index_trendtest_v3.nc, cesm_25_wd_index_trendtest_enso_v3.nc) p-value<=0.05 means significant. Trend is tested both based on 25 years and different phases of ENSO years. However, from hist to mid to end, there is sig. trend for some variables as the pr_extreme_dif_allyears_allruns_v2.pdf shows. To further evaluate this, just test the significance of the difference as we will do below.$

%plot the event number, event duration, mean intensity when pr rate is above 20mm and 40mm. The difference between ElNi\~no and LaNi\~na is similar to the days changes see wdevent_20mm_40mm_Mid_End_ElNi\~no-LaNi\~na_wet&dry.pdf in the data analysis file directory. The other differences have also been checked, no meaningful result.

%When the pr goes to really extreme, we care about its duration and event number, therefore, we also plot the result of event number, event duration when pr rate is above 20mm and 40mm

%Result: a) Overall, comparing with End to Hist, based on all the ensemble mean, despite of specific ENSO phases, the maximum one-day Pr increased has sig. increased over northern western and central part of WUS. Also, the features of wet events including mean Pr rate and largest total Pr has increased over that area. Also, the features of rain event (including 10,20,30) have changed including all the five features especially over northern western of WUS. Hist and Mid did not really show obvious difference.

%note: When testing the significance of difference, it seems not reasonable to compare ensemble means, therefore, we appends ensemble runs to get more values to test the difference.

%It seems that the percentile does not even matters. So, remove this.

\section{Discussion and Summary} \label{sec:Summary}

In this study, North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is not analyzed as its decades duration making it hard to be well captured over 26 years time period. Further, as argued by \cite{pierce2002role}, the NPO turned out to respond to the same internal atmospheric variability as ENSO, therefore, no significant improvement can be obtained to account for the ENSO's effects by incorporating accurate predictions of NPO SSTs. 

The associated precipitation signal under warmer climate is more ambiguous for California \citep{neelin2013california} considering the extreme variability on interannual time scales \citep{dettinger2011climate}. \cite{kim2005projection} found that under global warming, heavy precipitation events show largest increases in the mountainous regions of the northern California Coastal Range and the Sierra Nevada. However, our results show a minor decrease (though not statistically significant) of extreme precipitation over the Sierra Nevada. 

%*****As suggested by \cite{hamlet2007effects}, global warming has played a relatively minor role in determining cool season precipitation trends over historic period with an obvious change in the interannual variability across the West.

%In our study, the signal of global warming in regulating the behaviors of precipitation is also not as obvious as the impact of large scale variability (i.e. ENSO). 

Although, the strength of ENSO intensifies in future in CESM, it still remains uncertain that whether El Ni\~no will change under global warming by altering the background climate or not as debated by plenty of studies \citep{fedorov2000nino, guilyardi2009understanding}. There is still a lack of model agreement in whether ENSO is going to weaken or strengthen in response to increasing greenhouse gases with ENSO appears to be relatively insensitive to double CO$_2$ in most models \citep{dinezio2012mean}. It seems that it is still a challenge to correctly simulate the spatial pattern of the observed SST trends with the state-of-the-art coupled GCMs \cite{joseph2006enso, jha2014sst, taschetto2014cold}. \cite{capotondi2013enso} showed that the diversity of El Ni\~no characteristics in CCSM4 is comparable to what was found in observations, though the overall magnitude of ENSO in CCSM4 is overestimated by ~30$\%$ over preindustrial time period as found by \cite{deser2012enso}. \cite{stevenson2012will} assessed ENSO in CCSM4 (earlier form of CESM) and stated that no signal in the twentieth versus twenty-first-century ensembles is found, as also argued by \cite{philip2006shifts}. Large ensembles are needed to isolate significant ENSO climate change responses, and inter-model teleconnection differences \citep{stevenson2012significant}.

%***and twenty-first-century simulations may be too short for identification of significant tropical variability response to climate change, suggesting that changes to ENSO impacts may be obvious before changes to oceanic tropical variability itself become significant. However, large ensembles are needed to isolate significant ENSO climate change responses, and inter-model teleconnection differences \citep{stevenson2012significant}.

%The projected changes in the precipitation characteristics in the WUS are mainly associated with increases in the cool season water vapor influx from the Pacific Ocean. 

The increased cool season precipitation extremes tend to result in higher runoff events over northwest U.S. with greater chances of flooding under the projected warmer climate at the expense of snowfall. Also, the decrease of rainy days during warm season over central and southern California, though with a minor magnitude, will probably intensify the drought condition due to the deficit of soil moisture with higher evaportranspiration caused by the warmer climate in the future \cite{cayan2010future, bell2004regional}.

%that ENSO changes may become significant on centennial time scale and This suggests that changes to ENSO impacts may take place well before changes to oceanic tropical variability itself become significant. and the lack of signal in the twentieth- versus twenty-first-century ensembles is due to their limited duration. An examination of atmospheric teleconnections, in contrast, shows that the remote influences of ENSO do respond rapidly to climate change in some regions, particularly during boreal winter. This suggests that changes to ENSO impacts may take place well before changes to oceanic tropical variability itself become significant.

It turns out that the increasing greenhouses gas can reduce some changes caused by increasing of SST over most regions, though the effect is less than the SST. This is consistent with what the \citep{sugi2004mechanism} founded.

%\citep{sugi2004mechanism} "atmospheric general circulation model to investigate the separate effects of CO2 increase and sea surface temperature (SST) increase. It has been shown that the effect of CO2 increase is a reduction of radiative cooling in the lower troposphere, leading to a reduction of tropical precipitation. When atmospheric CO2 concentration is doubled (quadrupled) without changing the SST, the tropical precipitation is reduced by about 3$\%$ (6$\%$) in the model. The reduction of radiative cooling is a result of the overlap effect of the CO2 15-mm and water vapor absorption bands. On the other hand, the effect of SST increase is the increase in atmospheric temperature and water vapor, leading to increases in radiative cooling and tropical precipitation. When SST is uniformly raised 28C without changing the atmospheric CO2 concentration, the tropical precipitation is increased by about 6$\%$." "When both CO2 and SST are increased, as in the real-world global warming, tropical precipitation would increase due to the dominant effect of SST increase (Table 2; WARM2)." also see \citep{allen2002constraints}
