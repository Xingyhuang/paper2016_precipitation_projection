\section{Introduction}

Precipitation changes have always been an important issue that bring a lot attention in climate modeling studies, due to its significant impacts on our socioeconomic and natural systems, especially for water resources, drought occurrence and heavy precipitation events \citep{seneviratne2012changes}. A number of studies trying to find out how the precipitation will behave in future based on varied climate forcing scenarios under anthropogenic-induced changes \citep{hegerl2004detectability, kharin2007changes, scoccimarro2013heavy}, summarize that the world is getting wetter under a warmer climate. The intensity of extreme precipitation is projected to increase under global warming in many parts of the world, even in the regions where mean precipitation decreases \citep{tebaldi2006going, kharin2007changes}.

%Changes in rainfall distributions have attracted much attention because of the particular vulnerability of human activities to hydrological extreme events such as flood-producing rains and droughts. 
%The intensity of extreme precipitation is projected to increase under global warming in many parts of the world, even in the regions where mean precipitation decreases

%Globally, heat extremes have been increasing, with reducing extreme low temperatures


Although prediction of future climate has large uncertainty, climate model simulations are nonetheless the most useful information we can resort to study potential climate variability and extremes changes in future \citep{easterling2000climate}. Global climate models (GCMs) are commonly used to investigate possible future changes for the mean, variability and extremes of climate, forced with predicted greenhouse gas concentrations (GHGs) and aerosol emissions. Precipitation extremes measured in varied metrics are predicted to change by future warming based on GCMs results \citep{meehl2006future}. A large amount of studies work on the global changes of climate \citep{seneviratne2012changes}, but much less efforts focus on the regional scale. Although the human-induced increases in greenhouse gases have been attributed to the observed intensification of heavy precipitation events over tropical ocean \citep{allan2008atmospheric} or over majority of the Northern Hemisphere land areas \cite{min2011human}, the contribution could diverse largely regionally due to atmospheric circulation patterns of variability \citep{trenberth2011changes}, which can not be accurately described by coarse resolution used in the previous studies. More attention is needed to be paid on regional climate changes in order to implement climate adaptation and mitigation strategies effectively. 



For this purpose, due to the coarse resolutions ($\sim$1$^\circ$) of GCMs, regional climate models (RCMs) are mostly used to get the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme events, by better capturing local fine-scale dynamical features under high horizontal resolution \citep{bell2004regional, frei2006future, rauscher2010resolution, wehner2013very}. Higher resolution can allow more accurate simulation of precipitation extremes, related with regional representation in land use, land–water contrast, snow cover, cloudiness and circulation patterns associated with finer topography \citep{leung2003regional, diffenbaugh2005fine, salathe2008high, wehner2010effect}. \cite{diffenbaugh2005fine} studied both hot and wet events over the contiguous United States based on RCMs simulation at 25 km horizontal resolution, showing that fine-scale processes are critical for accurate assessment of local and regional scale vulnerability to climate change. \cite{leung2003hydroclimate} showed that the higher-resolution nest of RCMs yields more realistic precipitation patterns and produces more frequent heavy precipitation over western U.S. (WUS), which is consistent with observations.

%\citep{mass2011extreme} this paper has detailed discussion of precipitation extremes over western US modeled by other studies. (see the last two paragraphs)

%However, it does not mean that higher resolution can always perform better, and this aspect will be investigated in our study through multi-scale simulations including ~10km horizontal resolution.

%"Simulations with global coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation models (CGCMs) forced with projected greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions are the primary tools for studying possible future changes in climate mean, variability, and extremes. Changes in rainfall distributions have attracted much attention because of the particular vulnerability of human activities to hydrological extreme events such as flood-producing rains and droughts.

%"climate model improvements have resulted in an enhanced ability to simulate many aspects of climate variability and extremes. However, they are still characterized by systematic errors and limitations in accurately simulating regional climate conditions." \citep{easterling2000climate}

Except RCMs, variable-resolution enabled GCMs (VRGCMs) are also one of the dynamical downscaling methods that has been receiving a growing interest in modeling regional climate recently. Unlike RCMs, which are forced by the output from GCMs for future projections, VRGCMs use a relatively coarse global model with enhanced resolution over a specific study region \citep{staniforth1978variable, fox1997finite}. VRGCMs have demonstrated comparable utility for regional climate studies at a reduced computational cost compared to uniform-resolution GCMs \citep{fox2006variable, rauscher2013exploring}. Contrasted with RCMs, VRGCMs use a single, unified modeling framework rather than two separate models (GCM and RCM) with potentially disparate dynamics and physical parameterizations, avoiding the inconsistencies and lack of two-way interactions between the global and regional scales at the nest boundary of RCMs \citep{mcdonald2003transparent, laprise2008challenging, mesinger2013limited}. 

In this study, we use the recently developed variable-resolution option in Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) to get the potential changes of precipitation extremes till the end of 21st century over western U.S. (WUS), where particular vulnerability to hydrological extreme events including floods and droughts \citep{leung2003hydroclimate, caldwell2010california} is attributed. For decades, CESM (and its predecessor, the Community Climate System Model (CCSM)) has been used for global climate studies \citep{neale2010description, hurrell2013community} with competitive ability compared to other climate models. The overall performance of VR-CESM in regional climate representations has been addressed in detail in \cite{huang2016evaluation} over California, which demonstrates VR-CESM has competitive biases when compared to a traditional regional climate model, as evaluated against high-quality observations and reanalysis datasets. VR-CESM has also been employed by other studies showing the comparable ability in capturing fine-scale atmospheric processes as uniform CESM or a RCM, without apparent artifacts over the resolution transition region \citep{zarzycki2014using, zarzycki2015effects, rhoades2015characterizing}.

%In our study, and previous studies (e.g. \cite{zarzycki2015effects}), general circulation patterns (e.g., wind, pressure and precipitation) do not exhibit apparent artifacts in the variable-resolution transition region, and the design of the SE dynamical core ensures that dry air and tracer mass are conserved globally \citep{taylor2010compatible}.

%statistical downscaling

%\cite{rhoades2015characterizing} has also assessed the promising use of VR-CESM for modeling Sierra Nevada mountain snowpack in the western United States. Variable resolution has also been employed by \cite{zarzycki2014using} to show that a high-resolution refinement patch in the Atlantic basin for simulating tropical cyclones represented significant improvements over the unrefined simulation. \cite{zarzycki2015effects} have compared the large-scale climatology of VR-CESM 0.25$^\circ$ and uniform CESM at 1$^\circ$, evaluated with reanalysis (MERRA, NCEP) dataset, and found that adding a refined region over the globe did not significantly affect the global circulation. In our study, as in \cite{zarzycki2015effects}, general circulation patterns (e.g., wind, pressure and precipitation) do not exhibit apparent artifacts in the variable-resolution transition region, and the design of the SE dynamical core ensures that dry air and tracer mass are conserved globally \citep{dennis2011cam, taylor2010compatible, taylor2011conservation}.


%VR-CESM is driven by the Community Atmosphere Model's (CAM's) Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core, which possesses attractive conservation and parallel scaling properties \citep{dennis2011cam, taylor2011conservation}, as well as recently developed variable-resolution capabilities \citep{zarzycki2014aquaplanet, zarzycki2015experimental}. 


In this paper, we focus on the changes of precipitation behaviors during 21st Century over WUS based on long-term ensemble runs conducted by VR-CESM at the grid resolution of 0.25$^\circ$. Simulations are performed following the RCP (representative concentration pathway) 8.5 scenario, representing the highest rate of increase in GHGs within the new set of RCPs. We anticipate to obtain the changes of overall precipitation and the distributions of precipitation frequency and intensity under warmer climate with high-resolution simulations from the recent-climate to the end of 21st Century. This study aims to further improve our understanding of both past and future regional precipitation behaviors at fine-scale. The central hypothesis of this paper is that mean precipitation and precipitation extremes undergo different characteristics of changes regulated by a predicted scenario for different regions. The different intensity of the temperature increase can also result in different patterns of precipitation changes. We also want to emphasize that the teleconnection effect (e.g. El Nin\~o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) might dominate the precipitation features over particular area under the changes of mean sea surface temperature (SST) and its variations.

This work builds on a number of previous studies that have explored the changes of precipitation covering our study area in future. For example, \cite{kim2005projection} applied downscaled climate change signals in a selected indicators suggesting that the global warming induced by increased CO$_2$ is likely to increase extreme hydrologic events in the WUS. \cite{duffy2006simulations} found that precipitation extremes show increasing trend over the WUS with the spatial distributions vary substantially among the different RCMs. \cite{gao2015dynamical} pointed out a strikingly large increase of atmospheric river days by the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario over WUS. For our study, we employ relatively high resolution ($\sim$28 km) covering the WUS over long-term period (26 years) of each time phase. We use a variable-resolution global climate model (rather than the low-resolution GCMs or RCMs that have been previously used). Also, a different sets of indices are used to describe the changes of precipitation behaviors with a comprehensive analysis of potential causes including the effect of ENSO and climate forcing.

\section{Models and Methodology}

\subsection{Model setup}

As a state-of-the-art Earth modeling framework, CESM consists of coupled atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea ice models \citep{CAM5Tech, hurrell2013community}. In this study, Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) \citep{CAM5Tech} and the Community Land Model version 4.0 \citep{CLM40Tech} are applied. CAM 5 is set with the Spectral Element (SE) dynamical core having the conservation and parallel scaling properties \citep{dennis2011cam, taylor2011conservation} and variable-resolution option supported \citep{zarzycki2014using}. Global SSTs and sea ice are prescribed in accordance with the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocol \citep{Gates1992}, which are widely used supporting climate model diagnosis, validation and intercomparison. The finest horizontal resolution is $\sim$28 km covering the WUS, with a quasi-uniform 1$^\circ$ mesh over the remainder of the globe (See Figure \ref{fig:Figure 1}). A detailed description of the employed techniques of VR-CESM, including the grids generation, topography preparation and component set, can be found in \cite{rhoades2015characterizing} and \cite{huang2016evaluation}. 

%The coupling infrastructure in CESM communicates the interfacial states and fluxes between each component model to ensure conservation. Since we follow AMIP protocols, only the atmosphere and land model are integrated dynamically. The FAMIPC5 (F$\_$AMIP$\_$CAM5) component set, which mainly supports atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea ice models, is chosen for these simulations. In CAM5, cloud microphysics is parameterized using the two-moment scheme with with ice supersaturation \citep{ morrison2008new, gettelman2008new}, and the deep convection process is treated by Zhang and McFarlane (ZM) cumulus scheme \citep{zhang1995sensitivity}. A more detailed discussion of the CAM5 configuration can be found in \citet{neale2010description}.


Simulations have been conducted for both historical climate and transient future projections. The historical simulations cover the period of year 1979 through 2005 (Hereafter as Hist), representing the reference period for model evaluation and for the calculation of climate changes. The transient future projections cover two periods including near future 2024-2050 (Hereafter as Mid) and late-century 2074-2100 (Hereafter as End). For purposes of analysis, the first year of each time period was discarded as a spin-up period to allow adequate time for the initialized land and atmosphere to equilibrate. The 26-year duration was chosen to provide an adequate sampling of annual variability for each time phase. For future projections, GHG concentrations are set based on RCP 8.5 senario which describes GHG emissions continue to rise throughout the 21st century \citep{riahi2011rcp}. Simulations are forced by observed SSTs and sea ice for historical period at 1$^\circ$ as described by \citet{hurrell2008new}, and simulated SSTs and sea ice for future time period provided by Cecile Hannay from fully-coupled RCP 8.5 climate simulations with bias corrections ({\color{red}{no citation}}), without the added complexity of ocean-atmosphere feedbacks in the climate system. Using prescribed SSTs rather than coupled ocean model reduces considerable computation cost allowing the atmospheric model to be run at higher resolution balancing the overall accuracy. Land surface datasets at $0.5$$^\circ$ were adopted with yearly update.

%SST file: /glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/atm/cam/sst

%In particular, observed SSTs and sea ice at 1$^\circ$ horizontal resolution are provided and updated following the procedure described by \citet{hurrell2008new}.

Ensemble runs are needed to account for the uncertainty in climate projections, especially for climatological statistics associated with temperature and precipitations. However, due to the diverse internal variabilities for different climate models and for different climate variables, there is no standard criteria for the minimum number of simulations needed for climate studies \citep{deser2012uncertainty}. Based on the results of \cite{deser2012uncertainty}, at least three ensemble runs are required to detect a significant epoch difference for the JJA surface temperature, and for precipitation, more than 40 ensemble runs are needed. Considering that we did not explicitly use coupled ocean model and we focused on regional area at much finer resolution, in this study, we did four runs for each future time period. We also have two runs for the historical period. Due to the relatively small uncertainty within the ensemble runs (see the supplement), we assume that the numbers of runs applied in this study are enough to satisfy our goal. 

%According to Ryan L. Sriver et al. (2014) {\color{red}(add citation)}, CESM ensemble show obviously smaller uncertainty than Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase (CMIP) 5 for both temperature and precipitation in North America.

%The use of an ensemble of simulations is particularly useful for also determining the statistics of the climatology generated in each case, including the mean and variance associated with each of the variables of interest.

%Actually, former studies of regional high-resolution climate extremes usually use no more than five members \citep{diffenbaugh2010intensification}. We will analyze the uncertainty among multi-scale simulations for heat and precipitation extremes distribution. We may increase the ensemble members if needed and computation resources allowed.

%multi-member ensemble simulations provide additional insight into sources of uncertainty within a model simulation (Rougier et al. 2009; Flato et al. 2013).

%GCM: meehl2004more use four for past, five for future; VRGCM with one simulation seem ok for past climate; based on sriver_ppt_Analyzing climate impacts using a low resolution CESM ensemble, pg18, five ensemble should be ok for heat extremes, but not enough for precipitation extremes, one VRGCM should be ok for mean climate.

%Richard: In fact, if you are doing 1 model run for historical simulations and only 5 for future climate, it is very unlikely you will have any unambiguous results. An example reference might be Deser et al, 2012, Nature Climate Change. Wallace, Fischer, Thompson, and Deser discussed this at length in their 4 separate talks at AGU last month. Deser has another paper which looks at numbers of model runs or time periods or similar needed and it is different for max T than for precipitation.


\section{Methodology}

In order to thoroughly capture the features of precipitation distributions, all the daily output are utilized to account for varied precipitation events occurring in different seasons for diverse climate regions. As a common approach, indices are employed to depict the behaviors of precipitation \citep{tebaldi2006going, zhang2011indices, sillmann2013climate}. Multiple relevant indices have been tested including those defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and others from previous studies depicting either the percentiles, maximum value, or the events changes of precipitation. Loosely based on those former indices, we end up with a new sets of quantities that better fit our purpose, with the consideration of easy interpretation and relevance for policy makers. The indices employed are summarized in Table \ref{tab:table1} characterizing the different ranges of precipitation distributions.

%indices:  zhang2010influence, duliere2011extreme, 
%In this study, we have used selected indices in previous studies  \citep{tebaldi2006going, zhang2010influence, duliere2011extreme, zhang2011indices, sillmann2013climate} and also defined other indices that are suitable, well interpreted and describe extremes in a comprehensive and objective way. 
%(Before using indices method for extreme analysis, we need to select indices which are suitable, as easy as possible to be interpreted, being relevant for policy makers and describe extreme processes in a comprehensive and objective way \citep{sanchez2004future}.)

%The indices we used are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Table1} {\color{red}add table 1 based on $pr_extreme_Hist_2runs.pdf$}. We can divide the indices into two types. One kind is to describe the overall features of precipitation including the {\color{red} to be added}. The other kind is to define precipitation events, using specific rain rates of 1mm, 10 mm, 20 mm, 30mm, 40 mm and 50 mm as the thresholds. Specifically, a event is captured at each grid cell with consecutive days of rain rate exceeding corresponding threshold. A dry event is defined similarly except that it is the days without rain (Pr<=1.0mm/day). When capturing wet events, rainy days with precipitation rate less than the specific threshold are not treated as gap for different spells, and are surely not included in the wet event's duration length. 

%The indices are loosed based on the ones defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), which have been widely accepted and applied.


ENSO is also investigated in our study due to its important effects in regulating the precipitation over large part of our study area, especially in southwest U.S. \citep{cayan1999enso, zhang2010influence, deser2012communication, yoon2015increasing}. The phase of ENSO (i.e. El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na) is identified for each year by the Oceanic Ni\~no Index (ONI), defined as the 3-month running means of SST anomalies in the Ni\~no 3.4 region (covering 5N-5S, 120-170W based on \cite{noaaElNino}). A full-fledged El Ni\~no or La Ni\~na episode is identified when the ONI exceeds +0.5 or -0.5 for at least five consecutive months \citep{noaaElNino} (see the supplement). The base SST climatologies are derived from the mean of the period for year 1971-2000, 2020-2050 and 2070-2100 for Hist, Mid and End respectively, using the observed SST dataset and predicted SST dataset as aforementioned. In order to separate the SST changes from the influence of climate forcing, the SST values for future time period have been detrended before calculating the ONI index. 

Some studies argue that Ni\~no 3.4 can not capture ENSO well (like \cite{kao2009contrasting}), and we tried to widen the location (from 105W to 170W rather than from 120W to 170W ). It turns out that the SST anomaly of each year is quite similar to what we got from Ni\~no 3.4, especially for future periods. Therefore, we presume it won't really affect our results whether the location extends or not. ({\color{red}might remove this?})

%linear regression is applied to signaling the factor effects due to ENSO and climate forcing. Firstly, we get the phase of ENSO over each year including El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na and normal state at each grid point over our study area followed by the way of ENSO 3.4 (add citation here) (add more details about how ENSO is calculated over each time period). Next, we naturally divide climate forcing into three scenarios represented by each time period. The features of wet or dry spell as we described above are used as response variable. Mathematically, the regression relationship can be written as, (add equation and explain it here).

%(fulfill the model assumption (p-norm) and the sizes should be enough)

Student's t-test has been used to test whether two sets of dataset at each grid point are statistically significantly different, if the sample population can be adequately described by a normal distribution. The normality of a dataset is assessed under the Anderson-Darling test. When the sample populations do not approximately follow a normal distribution, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test is employed in lieu of the t-test. All these tests are evaluated at the 0.05 ($\alpha$) significance level.

%statistical significance for necessary variables: note the ad.test is based on sample size >7, therefore, this does not fit for extreme events that happen too less, combined all ensembles to get enough sample size

\subsection{Reference datasets}

Gridded observational datasets and reanalysis of the highest available quality with comparable horizontal resolutions are used for model evaluation. The use of multiple reference datasets is necessary due to the underlying uncertainty in the reference data. Descriptions of these datasets are as follows.

\paragraph{UW} The UW daily gridded meteorological data is obtained from the Surface Water Modeling group at the University of Washington \citep{maurer2002long, hamlet2005production}. UW incorporates topographic corrections for the precipitation. The dataset is provided at 0.125$^\circ$ horizontal resolution covering the period 1949 to 2010.

\paragraph{NCEP CPC} This dataset provides gauge-based analysis of daily precipitation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC). It is a suite of unified precipitation products obtained by combining all information available at CPC via the optimal interpolation objective analysis technique. The gauge analysis covers the Conterminous United States with a fine-resolution at 0.25$^\circ$ from 1948-01-01 to 2006-12-31.

\paragraph{NARR}  The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) is the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) high-resolution reanalysis product that provides dynamically downscaled data over North America at $\sim$32 km resolution and 3-hourly intervals from 1979 through present \citep{mesinger2006north}.


%Differences between gridded observations can be due to the choice of meteorological stations, interpolation techniques, elevation models and processing algorithms.

%ASD:  (“The high-resolution CESM was run under “present-day” (year 2000) greenhouse gas conditions (fixed CO2 concentration of 367 ppm). This was chosen so that direct comparisons could be made with recent-era observations of fine-scale and large-scale phenomena.”)  https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/home.html

\section{Results}


\subsection{Evaluation}

%(percentile and event number etc. in $index1\_ref\&hist.pdf$ (from v4) can be put in the supplement, the new features from v5 can also be added in the supplement)

In order to see whether the model can capture the historical features of precipitation, the results from VR-CESM and references are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 2} and Figure \ref{fig:Figure 3} using the indices defined in Table \ref{tab:table1}. It can be seen that compared to observations, VR-CESM can well reproduce the spatial patterns of precipitation with quite similar magnitude, considering the uncertainty within the references. Majority of the precipitation distributed over the Northwest coastal area and mountainous regions of the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. We do notice that VR-CESM overestimated the SDII (for about 25$\%$-35$\%$) along the western flank of the Sierra Nevada and into the CV.

Besides the mean precipitation amount, the distributions of rainy days at each range are also satisfactorily represented by the model especially over the northwest and mountain ridges where most often raining occurred. However, the model tends to overestimate the rainy days over the eastern side of the Cascades and over the eastern relatively dry region of our study area including part of the Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico, for days with precipitation rate under 20 mm/day. Along with the rainy days of each defined range, the corresponding fraction of water amount is also well modeled. Most of the rain over dry area is obtained from non-extreme Pr (with Pr$=<$10mm/day), while most of the precipitation over wet area is from extreme Pr (when Pr$>$10mm/day). We found that the overestimation of the SDII in the model as aforementioned is mainly due to the overestimation of the extreme precipitation events (particularly for Pr$>$20mm/day). Biases in simulating extreme precipitation over the topographically complex regions have also been found by \cite{singh2013precipitation}, being attributed to excessively strong winds.

As a comparison for CESM at different resolutions, the results of uniform CESM at 1degree are also obtained. We found that the precipitation pattern over complex topography are poorly captured for uniform CESM at 1degree and the magnitude is obviously underestimated compared to VR-CESM and observations (see the supplement). This further proves the significance high resolution and fine topography representation in better capturing the precipitation features. Results are also provided for the output from a globally uniform CESM run at 0.25$^\circ$ spatial resolution with the finite volume (FV) dynamical core \citep{wehner2014effect}, showing no better performance comparing to VR-CESM (see the supplement).

\subsection{Mean climatology}

Before getting into the analysis of the changes of precipitation features, it is important to understand the overall mean climatology changes from past to future as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 4}. In order to show the seasonality of the precipitation, Pr is divided into the cool season (or wet season) from October to March and the warm season (or dry season) from April to September. Majority of the precipitation is from cool season over wet region resulted from large-scale patterns and from warm season for the dry area resulted from convection processes.

Along with enhanced GHGs concentration, the mean temperature increases for about 1.5 to 2 K from Hist to Mid and about 3 to 3.5 K from Mid to End. Despite the large variation of temperature intensity over different regions, the magnitude of temperature changes in future are quite consistent over all the area with a little lower trend over the regions closer to the ocean. The mean precipitation did not show large changes with lightly increase of less than 0.6 mm/day during cool season, less than 0.2 mm/day during warm season from Hist to Mid, and less than 1.0 mm/day during cool season from Mid to End. However, based on the t-test result shown in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 5}, the increase of mean precipitation is still significant. There is a minor decrease (about 0.1mm/day) of total precipitation over part of the westside of the Sierra Nevada during cool season from Hist to Mid with expansion to the southwest when going to the End. This decrease trend (about 0.15 mm/day) is also found over the Cascades and the western coastal area during warm season from Hist to Mid with larger magnitude and extending to farther inland from Mid to End. However, this decrease signal is not statistically significant.

In order to see whether the water vapor content can increase proportionally with the temperature changes followed by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, the 2m relative humidity (R2m) is also included in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 4}. Overall, R2m can basically keep the same with a minor improvement over the area that the magnitude of the mean temperature increase is not high enough. However, when the temperature keeping increase to certain point, R2m begins to decrease. If paying close observation, we can see that the changes of R2m show a loosely similar pattern but with opposite trend to the changes of mean temperature. Overall, as temperature continuing increase in future, the water vapor content over land can not increase fast enough relative to the rapid warming so that relative humidity will decrease on average, as argued by \cite{joshi2008mechanisms}, and also seen in other model simulations \citep{rowell2006causes} and observed on all continents \citep{simmons2010low}.

%{{\color{red}might calculate a correlation between T2avg and R2m}}


%there is a consistent increase of 2m relative humidity over coastal region and west side of the Sierra Nevada in future, and slight decrease over most of the region during wet seasons. For dry seasons, the 2m relative humidity has slight increase over central-southern part of WUS during mid-century, and overall decrease over the remaining study area, especially during end-century. However, we also notice that over the rainy days, the 2m relatively humidity increases during mid-century, but decrease over end-century, which might suggest that when temperature increase high enough, the water vapor is not enough to support the corresponding changes of relative humidity.


%(R2m shows some interesting results when average over the rainy days of each range, with increase during Mid century (this is different from the average changes over all days) but decrease during End century, which might suggest that when temperature increase high enough, the water vapor is not enough to support the corresponding changes of relative humidity.  This can be further explained by the Q2m and T2avg.)

%(About the dryness of the surface/underground and relative humidity)
%"The key factor causing drying is that land surfaces (and the air just above them) warm, on average, about 50$\%$ more than ocean surfaces \citep{joshi2008mechanisms}" "The second factor ensuring drying is that water vapor content over land does not increase fast enough relative to the rapid warming there." "Because the land warms faster than the oceans, however, the humidity of the arriving air does not increase enough to maintain a constant relative humidity. The latter must therefore fall on average (see the figure), as indeed seen in model simulations \citep{rowell2006causes} and observed on all continents \citep{simmons2010low}." "In a warmer climate, more rain is needed. Many regions will get more rain, but it appears that few will get enough to keep pace with the growing evaporative demand."


%The moisture flux at 850 hPa (horizontal transport of water vapor by the wind) (seems to be consistent with the changes of relative humidity) (how to interpret this?)

\subsection{Precipitation}

Based on the indices we defined in Table \ref{tab:table1}, the changes of precipitation behavior averaged over each 26 years are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 5} (for the indices of precipitation days) and Figure \ref{fig:Figure 6} (for the indices of precipitation amount) from past to future. Although the mean precipitation shows a week but overall increasing trend from Hist to Mid and Mid to End, the precipitation distributions exhibit different characters.

When comparing Hist to Mid, the total rainy days and frequency of non-extreme precipitation have significantly increased mainly over the central-east and southeast part of WUS, which is not observed between Mid and End. On the contrary, the total rainy days and frequency of non-extreme precipitation have decreased significantly over the northwest region and the eastern part of the Montana, Wyoming and Oregon from Mid to End. These can mainly explain the changes of mean precipitation as aforementioned in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 4}. 

%The combined changes of those is displayed when comparing Hist and End.

As for the extreme precipitation frequency (i.e. with daily Pr between 10 mm and 40 mm), there is a overall increase signal from Hist to Mid, but the pattern is scattered over northwest and central WUS. When comparing Mid to End, a clear and significant increase of extreme precipitation events can be observed over the northwest coastal area and eastern side of the Cascades. This result is consistent with what found by \cite{dominguez2012changes} stating a robust increases in the winter precipitation extremes toward the latter half of the 21st century using RCMs.

There are slight and not significant decreases (due to the high variation of precipitiaton) over the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. For the very extreme precipitation (Pr$>=$40 mm) events, there is a notable increasing trend over the northwest coast and the Cascades and its eastern side. The corresponding changes of rain amount are consistent with the changes of frequency (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 6}). Overall, precipitation predicts to be more extreme over northwest U.S.

({\color{red} might add the specific percentages for further illustrations})

%****According to previous studies (e.g. \citep{allen2002constraints, allan2008atmospheric, o2009physical, min2011human}), changes in more extreme precipitation follow the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, i.e. the atmospheric water vapor content increases at an approximate rate of 7.5$\%$ per kelvin of atmospheric temperature, more closely than total precipitation precipitation amount \citep{trenberth2003changing}. Based on CMIP3 simulation, \cite{kharin2007changes} argued that there will be an increase of annual one day maximum precipitation (Max1d) for about 6$\%$ with each kelvin of global warming, with ranging of 4$\%$-10$\%$ K with the models.

In order to figure out the causes behind those main signals, the changes of moisture flux is further investigated (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 8}) for cool seasons when majority precipitation results from the water vapor influx from the Pacific ocean. Taking the moisture flux at level of 850 hpa as representative, within expectation, specific humidity increases along with the increase of the temperature in future. However, comparing to Hist, the wind pattern in Mid and End also changes with reduced magnitude to the east over the eastern part of the WUS but with stronger wind to the western part. The integrated water vapor transport (IVT) is also depicted and included in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 8} for extreme precipitation days over cool seasons. Generally, IVT has been used to identify the major contribution of precipitation by atmospheric rivers over Northwest U.S. and the topographic forcing effect (especially for the very extreme precipitation) \citep{ralph2004satellite, leung2009atmospheric, dettinger2011climate}. Based on the IVT changes, it can be seen that the increase of moisture influx from past to future, which is mainly due to the change of the air water vapor content with the increased temperature, corresponds to the changes of precipitation extremes shown in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 5}.

%neiman2008meteorological

%the change of IWV is similar to the change of IVT, so not shown

In order to see the impacts of the large scale variability by ENSO from past to future, the difference of precipitation behaviors between the warm phase (i.e. El Ni\~no) and cool phase (i.e. La Ni\~na) of ENSO is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 7} for the wet seasons of each time period. Based on the ONI index values, the mean SST anomalies are 1.38, 1.71 and 2.30 K during El Ni\~n years, and -1.16, -1.62 and -1.43 K during La Ni\~na years for Hist, Mid and End respectively. The SST anomalies of each year or each month, and their spatial pattern averaged during the warm and cool phases can be found in the supplement ({\color{red}might adding some descriptions of these}).

%			Hist                Mid            		End
%La Ni\~na 		6, -1.163667  11, -1.616909  	11, -1.430182
%El Ni\~no		8, 1.38   10, 1.7149    	6,   2.297667

It can be seen that during El Ni\~no phases, higher precipitation intensity is expected over southwest U.S. \citep{hamlet2007effects}, and smaller precipitation intensity over the northwest U.S.. This feature is often characterized as a northwest/southwest precipitation dipole, causing by the effects of ENSO on cool season precipitation through the storm track behavior \citep{gershunov1998interdecadal, leung2003hydroclimate}, modulating the enhanced precipitation variability in the southern WUS \citep{cayan1999enso, kahya1994influences}. Consequently, the overall rainy days and extreme precipitation events also show that similar dipole pattern. In future, the impact of ENSO tends to intensify, which seems to be related with the changes of the strength of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. This can be explained by the SST anomaly magnitude (detrended) of warm and cold phases (see the supplement). \cite{deflorio2013western} also found a statistically significant linkages with ENSO and PDO for both the overall and extreme intensity of wintertime precipitation over the WUS using CCSM4 (earlier form of CESM). A strengthening patterns associated with ENSO is also found by \cite{maloney2014north} over California using CMIP5 output under RCP8.5. 


%***\cite{yoon2015increasing} found that the projected increase in water cycle extremes including intense drought and excessive flooding in California is associated with a strengthened relation to ENSO not only through its warm and cold phases but also its precursor patterns. The ENSO might shift in future under the changes in Northern Hemispheric low-frequency circulation and thermodynamic patterns \citep{berg2015increased}. 


({\color{red}For Figure 7, might add absolute values or percentage of changes, compared to the changes of climate forcing; explain why Pr and R5mm are not plotted.})

This is further proved by the IVT difference over rainy days between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 8} ) accompanying by the wind pattern difference at 850 hpa, showing the increase of the moisture flux for the southwest and decrease for the northwest. However, the impact of ENSO for observational precipitation has a weaker signal of the dipole effect compared to the VR-CESM (see the supplement), which might suggest that the model has a overestimation of the ENSO effect on precipitation, especially over the northwest U.S. The improvement of ENSO in the model is directly proportional to the representation of ENSO forced precipitation anomalies \citep{achutarao2006enso}.

Based on the above results, it can be seen that the magnitude of the effects of ENSO is comparable or even higher than the impacts of climate forcing. For further investigation, linear regression is applied to signaling the factor effects due to ENSO and climate forcing. First, we get the SST anomaly of each year at each grid point over our study area followed by the way of Ni\~no 3.4 to be the ENSO factor values. Then, we use the GHGs values at each year to represent the climate forcing factor. The features of the precipitation indices as we defined above are used as response variables. Combined the values of all the time period and all the runs, we got the significance of these two factors' effects at each grid point based on the ANOVA (analysis of variance) output. (see the supplement) ({\color{red}This is not complete yet, but not sure whether to add this or not}).

 %Here, we only focus on wet season, since the ENSO is defined by the anomaly over wet season, also, ENSO did not really impact the summer season rain features due to the scarcity of rain.

%ENSO did not really impact the summer season rain features; The overall differences between different time period over all years show some interesting features between dry and wet season, therefore, keeping this in seasons. As for the difference at each phase over each time period, it seems there is no necessary to do this, just using the anova model to get the significance.

%$note: It seems there is no overall significant trend of either event's features within each time period.

Also, the features of wet events including mean Pr rate and largest total Pr has increased over that area. Also, the features of rain event (including 10,20,30) have changed including all the five features especially over northern western of WUS. Hist and Mid did not really show obvious difference.

\section{Discussion and Summary}

In this study, North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is not analyzed as its decades duration making it hard to be well captured over 26 years time period. Further, as argued by \cite{pierce2002role}, the NPO turned out to respond to the same internal atmospheric variability as ENSO, therefore, no significant improvement can be obtained to account for the ENSO's effects by incorporating accurate predictions of NPO SSTs. 

The associated precipitation signal under warmer climate is more ambiguous for California \citep{neelin2013california} considering the extreme variability on interannual time scales \citep{dettinger2011climate}. \cite{kim2005projection} found that under global warming, heavy precipitation events show largest increases in the mountainous regions of the northern California Coastal Range and the Sierra Nevada. However, our results show a minor decrease (though not statistically significant) of extreme precipitation over the Sierra Nevada. 

%*****As suggested by \cite{hamlet2007effects}, global warming has played a relatively minor role in determining cool season precipitation trends over historic period with an obvious change in the interannual variability across the West.

%In our study, the signal of global warming in regulating the behaviors of precipitation is also not as obvious as the impact of large scale variability (i.e. ENSO). 

Although, the strength of ENSO intensifies in future in CESM, it still remains uncertain that whether El Ni\~no will change under global warming by altering the background climate or not as debated by plenty of studies \citep{fedorov2000nino, guilyardi2009understanding}. There is still a lack of model agreement in whether ENSO is going to weaken or strengthen in response to increasing greenhouse gases with ENSO appears to be relatively insensitive to double CO$_2$ in most models \citep{dinezio2012mean}. It seems that it is still a challenge to correctly simulate the spatial pattern of the observed SST trends with the state-of-the-art coupled GCMs \cite{joseph2006enso, jha2014sst, taschetto2014cold}. \cite{capotondi2013enso} showed that the diversity of El Ni\~no characteristics in CCSM4 is comparable to what was found in observations, though the overall magnitude of ENSO in CCSM4 is overestimated by ~30$\%$ over preindustrial time period as found by \cite{deser2012enso}. \cite{stevenson2012will} assessed ENSO in CCSM4 (earlier form of CESM) and stated that no signal in the twentieth versus twenty-first-century ensembles is found, as also argued by \cite{philip2006shifts}. Large ensembles are needed to isolate significant ENSO climate change responses, and inter-model teleconnection differences \citep{stevenson2012significant}.

%***and twenty-first-century simulations may be too short for identification of significant tropical variability response to climate change, suggesting that changes to ENSO impacts may be obvious before changes to oceanic tropical variability itself become significant. However, large ensembles are needed to isolate significant ENSO climate change responses, and inter-model teleconnection differences \citep{stevenson2012significant}.

%The projected changes in the precipitation characteristics in the WUS are mainly associated with increases in the cool season water vapor influx from the Pacific Ocean. 

The increased cool season precipitation extremes tend to result in higher runoff events over northwest U.S. with greater chances of flooding under the projected warmer climate at the expense of snowfall. Also, the decrease of rainy days during warm season over central and southern California, though with a minor magnitude, will probably intensify the drought condition due to the deficit of soil moisture with higher evaportranspiration caused by the warmer climate in the future \cite{cayan2010future, bell2004regional}.

({\color{red}Summary is to be added once the main content have been settled down})

%that ENSO changes may become significant on centennial time scale and This suggests that changes to ENSO impacts may take place well before changes to oceanic tropical variability itself become significant. and the lack of signal in the twentieth- versus twenty-first-century ensembles is due to their limited duration. An examination of atmospheric teleconnections, in contrast, shows that the remote influences of ENSO do respond rapidly to climate change in some regions, particularly during boreal winter. This suggests that changes to ENSO impacts may take place well before changes to oceanic tropical variability itself become significant.

It turns out that the increasing greenhouses gas can reduce some changes caused by increasing of SST over most regions, though the effect is less than the SST. This is consistent with what the \citep{sugi2004mechanism} founded.

%\citep{sugi2004mechanism} "atmospheric general circulation model to investigate the separate effects of CO2 increase and sea surface temperature (SST) increase. It has been shown that the effect of CO2 increase is a reduction of radiative cooling in the lower troposphere, leading to a reduction of tropical precipitation. When atmospheric CO2 concentration is doubled (quadrupled) without changing the SST, the tropical precipitation is reduced by about 3$\%$ (6$\%$) in the model. The reduction of radiative cooling is a result of the overlap effect of the CO2 15-mm and water vapor absorption bands. On the other hand, the effect of SST increase is the increase in atmospheric temperature and water vapor, leading to increases in radiative cooling and tropical precipitation. When SST is uniformly raised 28C without changing the atmospheric CO2 concentration, the tropical precipitation is increased by about 6$\%$." "When both CO2 and SST are increased, as in the real-world global warming, tropical precipitation would increase due to the dominant effect of SST increase (Table 2; WARM2)." also see \citep{allen2002constraints}
