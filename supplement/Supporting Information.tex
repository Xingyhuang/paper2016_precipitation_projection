\section{Supporting Information}

This supplement to the manuscript includes:

\begin{enumerate}
%\begin{itemize}

\item Figure S1: The difference of Pr indices results between each ensemble run and the ensemble mean averaged annually for each time period.

\item Figure S2: The monthly ONI index values for each time period.

\item Figure S3: Mean precipitation and associated indices from CESM at the resolution of 1$^\circ$ and 0.25$^\circ$ respectively over the historical period, 1980-2005.

\item Figure S4: Differences of precipitation indices Pr and R$\ast$mm between warm and cool phases of ENSO over the historical period for VR-CESM and reference datasets.

\item Figure S5: Spatial pattern of surface temperature anomalies when averaged over the warm and cool phases of ENSO of each time period.

\item Figure S6: The F-test significance of factors including ENSO and GHG obtained from ANOVA output.

\item Figure S7: The magnitude of the linear fitted regression response for mean precipitation and associated indices related with each factor.

%\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
